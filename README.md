# MathEngine
Developing a math based framework from scratch. Although I am a __beginner__ at this but I have been stoked by the ability of libraries like [!`Tensorflow`](https://tensorflow.org) and [!`Numpy`](https://www.numpy.org/) have the capability of representing and solving any form of equation, also the ability to perform autograd. So I thought I'll give it a shot at developing a framework like these from scratch. 

__NOTE:__ I am not concerned about the arrangements of struture of the files and classes as of yet, because developing the basic mth engine is a priority for now. 

## Checkout the dev1 branch where all the developments are taking place for now.
